anyway heres that annoying bot that we played around with during the valorant tournament. boy i should get paid for stuff like this.

### tiny confession:

i made this bot to host an event for delhi public school bangalore north. i do not know if they have changed their ways now, but they do not care for their student base in the least. they don't support us or compensate us for work. it was hard organizing everything myself, running around for permissions and eventually buying an entire projector for the event. the school doesn't care. i feel people should know how my friends and i were treated in the school, being the only ones proficient in tech, even amongst the teachers.
